  Red Balloon’s eviction comes over 40 years after Columbia attempted to evict another parent cooperative, the Children’s Free School, even as it worked to expand its child care support in the early 1970s through programs such as the Columbia Day Care Project which produced Red Balloon.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the spring of 1977, the University ordered the eviction of the Children’s Free School, located in a University-owned building on Morningside Drive, in order to demolish the building and make way for the construction of the East Campus dormitory. Like Red Balloon, the Children’s Free School was known for its innovative pedagogy, parent cooperative model, and affordability of tuition, which at the time amounted to about a third of average private school tuition in New York City.

  “We’re like a big family here and the children are happy, and that’s got to have an effect on the learning process,” one teacher at the Children’s Free School told the New York Times in April 1978, at the height of the school’s battle with Columbia to obtain an alternate rent-free space.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The school held two weeks of demonstrations against the eviction in April by holding classes on Low Plaza, and during the University commencement ceremonies in May, parents and children paraded at the College Walk gates with signs and balloons.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re trying to show Columbia what an unusual and special school they are supporting,” Alan Adelson, a spokesperson for the school, told the New York Times.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the fall of that year, Columbia offered the school a new site in a different University building.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Four decades later, Red Balloon parents and children took to College Walk with balloons and signs in hand. After obtaining over 15,000 signatures on a petition for the University to renew Red Balloon’s lease, the Red Balloon parent board on March 3 held a rally on Columbia’s Morningside campus that was supposed to culminate in a delivery of the petition to Low Library.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, after marching down College Walk together, the parents were denied entry to Low Library, with security guards refusing to let Annapurna Potluri Schreiber, the head of the parent board, and her daughter into the building.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Augusta Kappner, one of the first parents at Red Balloon in the 1970s and a former president of the Bank Street College of Education, was one of the Morningside Heights community members who attended the rally.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I was very surprised, and I think many, many people were very surprised that no one from the University came out to even acknowledge them and to, at minimum, say, ‘We’ll get these petitions to the appropriate person,’” Kappner said. “That would have been at least a goodwill gesture. These are parents with kids and strollers and balloons, not a mob.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  To Kappner and Nancy Kolben, who worked on the Columbia Day Care Project in the 1970s to help identify 560 Riverside Drive as a space for Red Balloon, the questions surrounding the University’s decision to close the school are difficult to unpack because of ambiguities in the nature of each affiliated center’s relationship with the University.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The University has very different relationships with the various programs that serve young children somehow connected to the University,” Kolben said. “It’s always been not a clear cut. Universities are very diverse in how they’ve dealt with child care issues and needs, but Columbia has never had a clearly, clearly defined policy.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Red Balloon’s cause has increasingly drawn support from student groups historically involved in advocacy for increased University resources for students and staff. Student-Worker Solidarity, which supported the Student Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers in its efforts to <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2022/01/28/after-a-10-week-strike-and-years-of-organizing-swc-uaw-members-vote-to-ratify-historic-contract/">win a contract</a> for graduate student workers in 2022 after <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/11/15/its-hard-to-do-both-the-swc-uaw-strikes-disruption-of-core-classes-leaves-undergraduates-stuck-between-learning-loss-and-solidarity/">months of striking</a>, spearheaded a student rally on Low Plaza on April 6 in support of Red Balloon.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Abigail Hall, CC ’25, was among the dozens of undergraduate students who attended the rally.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that child care is super important and it’s really evil—I guess is the word I would use—that it’s affecting kids,” Hall said, referring to the University’s eviction of Red Balloon. “Especially because it’s been there for 50 years and it’s provided so much support to the community, especially women of color … I think that’s really, really important. And the fact that Columbia is just going to shut it down is really heartbreaking.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Kappner said the University’s reasoning feels unsatisfying.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think that’s been the big mystery to many of us,” Kappner said. “Why does the University seem so averse to working with these parents to solve whatever the situation might be?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The University definitely has a responsibility to the community,” Oscar Lloyd, CC ’25, an organizer with Student-Worker Solidarity who helped lead the Red Balloon rally, said. “And providing child care is one of the most basic things.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Child care deserts, or areas lacking enough licensed child care slots to serve the number of children living there, are predominantly found in low- and middle-income communities. According to a national analysis of child care supply by the Center for American Progress, West Harlem is the single <a href="https://childcaredeserts.org">largest</a> child care desert in Manhattan.<b> </b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The disparities in child care supply in West Harlem are most clear in the infant age group. The child care center capacity in West Harlem would be able to serve less than 5 percent of all children in the area under two years old, according to a 2019 <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/nyc-under-three-a-plan-to-make-child-care-affordable-for-new-york-city-families/#_ednref34">study</a> published by the New York City Comptroller. Most other neighborhoods in Manhattan ranged from 10 to 24 percent. The areas encompassing Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, and Inwood had the lowest ratio of child care center capacity to children under two in all of Manhattan.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the child care crisis worsened even more, with many areas throughout New York state losing significant child care capacity. According to USA Today, almost two-thirds of child care providers throughout the state said in March 2020 that they could not stay closed for longer than a month and continue to survive.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In his February statement, Senior Vice Provost Dennis Mitchell said the University plans to replace Red Balloon with a nonprofit child care center. No new information has been made available since the statement, and the lack of public details surrounding the University’s plans for the space have concerned community leaders.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[It seems] that they are determined to have Red Balloon move out and set up their own operation or bring in another operator in there,” Barry Weinberg, chair of Community Board 9, said. “We don’t know if they’ll accept ACS vouchers. We don’t know if they’ll have accommodations for children with special needs.”
