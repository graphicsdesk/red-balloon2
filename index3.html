            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hannah Throssell, SSW ’24, said the lack of individualized outreach and support from the Office of Work/Life was especially discouraging throughout what she described as a “traumatic experience” in securing child care at Columbia.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I was in crisis,” Throssell said. “Like my account was in the negative, we were just living off of a credit card that obviously has a limit … Even now I’m still debating—is it worth another year of uncertainty?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  She is now contemplating switching to the online program for her degree.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There should have been a lot more support for students like me in the beginning,” Throssell said. “Work/Life could have sat me down and been like, ‘We can help you with this, we’ll teach you about how to apply for free public education. … You need a work-study job? Well, then let’s quickly find something remote.’ There should have been more services.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Enrolling her son in New York City’s universal 3-K program prior to moving was not an option because Throssell did not have a work-study position or a job secured in the city at the time, she said. And when she first emailed the Office of Work/Life about child care services, the office sent her a spreadsheet of Columbia-affiliated child care centers that can be <a href="https://worklife.columbia.edu/content/affiliated-early-learning-centers">accessed on the Office of Work/Life website</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “[I] asked if there was any discount for students or anything, and all of them gave me a really condescending, ‘No, we don’t do that,’” Throssell said, referring to her attempts to call some of the affiliated centers listed on the spreadsheet. “Because these daycares, preschools, they’re wanting to serve faculty or the doctors here that can afford to shell out $3,000 a month.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think every day I spend here too—it just communicates that Columbia definitely does not want to accommodate students like me,” she added.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The Office of Work/Life provides the same consulting assistance to student parents as they do to any other affiliates,” a Columbia spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator. “Their specialists go over lists and explain different child care options that are available and could meet their needs.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The spokesperson added that the Office of Work/Life offers resources including a bimonthly newsletter; workshops for parents with children of all ages, including one in February on the universal pre-K system; and information about child care options on the office’s website.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Submitting an appeal to the financial aid office to let her take out more loan money to pay for child care was also strenuous, Throssell said, in light of the time it took to compile receipts and contracts for daycare, health costs, groceries, and travel expenses. Throssell then waited an additional two weeks for the appeal to be reviewed and finalized.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’m not the only one,” Throssell said. “I met another parent and she was the one who was basically like, ‘Well, you have to dispute with financial aid and dispute a budget so that they can let you take out more loans to pay for child care.’ But that information wasn’t readily available.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The tuition costs of the preschools themselves, however, was one of Throssell’s top concerns.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I was like, ‘Who are they making these child care lists for, these programs for?’” Throssell said. “It’s not for undergraduate students [and] definitely not graduate students.”
</p>

  Though students and postdoctoral researchers are especially vulnerable to struggles in affording child care costs due to more limited incomes, Spectator reported in 2019 that these costs put even tenured and junior faculty members in a bind, forcing some to move out of New York City entirely.

  Out of the eight Columbia-affiliated child care centers that offer full-time care from approximately 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., five centers charge more than $3,000 per month in tuition.<b> </b>Other centers, such as the Columbia Greenhouse Nursery School, do not offer full-time care options, with the school day ending at 3:30 p.m.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  At Stanford University in Palo Alto, California—a city that, like New York, is known for remarkably expensive real estate and costs of living—tuition costs for Stanford-affiliated preschool-age child care centers range from $2,000 to $2,400 per month. Princeton University’s main child care center charges $2,141 per month for children of the same age.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  At <a href="https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards/worklife/children-family/site-child-care/child-care-tuition-support-for-students-and-postdocs">Stanford</a>, many students and postdoctoral researchers are eligible for some form of child care tuition assistance, with families making less than $65,000 per year able to receive a 20 percent tuition discount.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia does not set the tuitions at the affiliated centers,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator regarding student parents’ abilities to afford child care. “Apart from Tompkins Hall, Columbia affiliated centers are all independent schools and set the tuitions that they need to be able to run their schools and pay their teachers.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But for many student and postdoctoral parents, the inability to afford child care can be directly damaging to their capacity to attend and work at universities.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “In the grad school years and the postdoc years, those are your reproductive years, as a woman at least,” Ni Feng, a former postdoctoral researcher at Yale University and current assistant professor at Wesleyan University, said. “And so if you want to fix the pipeline problem in academia, you better help women have children at their prime.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Feng enrolled her child at a Yale-affiliated child care center in the years she was conducting research there. She said at Yale, she saw significant financial challenges for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in raising their children “unless they come from money,” whereas “the base salary is so much higher for faculty that they don’t really have to worry about child care.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think all universities need to do more to help graduate students and postdocs have children,” Feng said. “And especially in a city like New York, that must be already heartless to raising a child, let alone doing it on a postdoc or graduate student salary.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  With Red Balloon’s closure slated for this coming August, Throssell said she considered signing up for a consultation that Columbia offered Red Balloon parents to determine alternative child care options for next year, but that she ultimately opted not to do so.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “What are they realistically going to offer me?” Throssell said. “Are they just going to sit me down and go over the spreadsheet with me?”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Two other Red Balloon parents who signed up for consultations told Spectator that was exactly what the administrators did.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It wasn’t like, ‘We have an equivalent [to Red Balloon],’” Alison McIlvride said. “It was just like, ‘These are the other schools in the neighborhood. Good luck. Make sure you apply by the deadline so that you’re not stuck.’”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to McIlvride, the University did later offer one avenue for financial support for Red Balloon parents that she believes came too late.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Like the week before parents had to decide on a school based upon the private daycare deadline, [the University] said that they want to offer potentially some financial aid to parents who are already receiving financial aid at Red Balloon,” McIlvride said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  McIlvride said the timing of the announcement made it difficult for Red Balloon parents to research alternative schools, make the financial decision, and apply before the application deadline.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It was not something that was communicated earlier on to the extent that I think there might have been parents who might have looked into other schools and might have benefited from that assistance, having known that that was potentially available to them,” McIlvride said. “So, I think Columbia, from their perspective, might pat themselves on the back and be like, we helped some families make ends meet financially, but no one could have made an informed decision about that unless that had been communicated much earlier on.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Augusta Kappner believes the new preschool slated to move into the space at 560 Riverside Drive should maintain several qualities that Red Balloon currently offers.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “One, it should be affordable,” Kappner said. “Two, it should be full-day. Three, it should be full-year. I take for granted that it would be high-quality. And it should be accessible to disabled kids with special needs. And it should have some parent engagement in how the learning goes and how it is run.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But, similar to what many parents have expressed when speaking about Red Balloon, McIlvride sees the spirit of community at Red Balloon as one of the biggest losses for Columbia affiliates that may not be so easily replicated.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It wasn’t the same thing as coming to Red Balloon where she just loves it there and runs in every day and loves her friends and loves her teachers,” McIlvride said, referring initially to her daughter’s previous preschool. “It’s a noticeable difference. And I think there’s not really much attention paid to the quality of community there when Columbia’s talking about the school and making its decision.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Now, with her son recently diagnosed on the autism spectrum, Throssell said navigating the landscape of potential special education services beyond Red Balloon has been difficult, though she said Denise Fairman, the school’s director, has been helping in the past few months to make the process easier for her.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If now, [the Office of Work/Life is] able to do a consultation, and if I bring all of my issues to the table, I wonder if they’ll actually be able to help,” Throssell said. “I don’t know.”
