  When Hannah Throssell, SSW ’24, prepared to pack her suitcases in summer 2022 to start her master’s program at the School of Social Work, she said she encountered the most stress not from her upcoming classes or leaving behind her home in Arizona, but over finding childcare for her toddler son.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When Throssell reached out to Columbia’s Office of Work/Life to request help with finding child care, the office sent her a one-page <a href="https://worklife.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Columbia%20Affiliated%20Early%20Learning%20Centers%202021.xlsx">spreadsheet</a> of Columbia’s affiliated child care centers, she said. Even on a first scan, Throssell was stunned by the tuition costs—many of which surpass $30,000 per year for full-time care.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Without the financial means to pay the high costs or any family members able to move with her to New York City to help care for her son, Throssell found herself at a loss. She ended up calling all of the centers on the list.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Red Balloon Learning Center was one of them.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Poor Denise—she just got this frantic phone call, me crying like, ‘I need child care. I don’t know what to do. We’re supposed to leave in two weeks, I’m literally selling everything here in Arizona just so I can make the move to New York for school,’” Throssell said.
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Denise Fairman, the executive director of Red Balloon, which Throssell’s son currently attends, told her that she would talk to the school’s parent board and see what it could do. Ultimately, Throssell said Red Balloon was able to offer her a tuition rate of $1,500 per month, marked down from its standard $2,500 per month.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For Throssell and many young parents like her, the affordability of Red Balloon tuition and its ability to meet the individual needs of low-income families has been essential in their abilities to study and work at Columbia. Formed initially as a parent cooperative in the 1970s in response to University child care needs, Red Balloon has operated without having to pay rent in a University-owned building for 50 years. In summer 2022, however, Columbia notified the school that it would have to leave the space by August 2023.
